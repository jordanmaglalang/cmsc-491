Overview
Morning sickness is feeling like throwing up, also called nausea, and throwing up, also called vomiting, that occurs during pregnancy. Despite its name, morning sickness can strike at any time of the day or night.
Many people have morning sickness, especially during the first three months of pregnancy. But some people have morning sickness all through pregnancy. Home remedies, such as snacking during the day and sipping ginger ale or taking medicine you can buy without a prescription, might help relieve nausea.


Rarely, morning sickness is so bad that it turns into hyperemesis gravidarum. This is when the nausea and vomiting cause serious fluid loss or loss of more than 5% of pre-pregnancy body weight. Hyperemesis gravidarum might require going to a hospital for treatment.
Symptoms
Nausea, with or without vomiting, is common in pregnancy. Morning sickness is often brought on by smelling certain odors or eating certain foods.
Morning sickness is most common during the first three months of pregnancy. It typically starts before nine weeks. Symptoms usually improve by the middle or end of the second three months of pregnancy.
When to see a doctor
Contact your health care provider if:
You produce no urine or only a little urine that's a dark color.
You can't keep liquids down.
You feel dizzy or faint when you stand up.
Your heart races.

 Causes
The cause of morning sickness is not known. Hormone changes might play a role. Rarely, a medical condition not related to pregnancy, such as thyroid or gallbladder disease, can cause serious nausea or vomiting.
Risk factors
Morning sickness can affect anyone who's pregnant, but it might be more likely for those who:
Had nausea or vomiting from other causes before becoming pregnant, such as motion sickness or migraines.
Had morning sickness during a prior pregnancy.
Are pregnant with twins or other multiples.
Hyperemesis gravidarum might be more likely for those who:
Are pregnant with a girl.
Have a family history of hyperemesis gravidarum.
Have had hyperemesis gravidarum during an earlier pregnancy.
Complications
Mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy usually won't cause harm.
If left untreated, severe nausea and vomiting can cause a lack of bodily fluids, a condition known as dehydration. It also may lead to an imbalance in electrolytes — the salts in blood that control the balance of fluids in the body. Severe nausea and vomiting may result in less urine output. Research is mixed on whether hyperemesis gravidarum causes poor weight gain for the baby during pregnancy.
Prevention
There's no sure way to prevent morning sickness. However, taking a daily vitamin supplement before and during pregnancy might help.

Seek immediate medical attention
Ask someone to drive you to urgent care or an emergency room if:
Nausea and vomiting are accompanied by pain or a severe headache, especially if you haven't had this type of headache before
You have signs or symptoms of dehydration — excessive thirst, dry mouth, infrequent urination, dark-colored urine and weakness, or dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing
Your vomit contains blood, resembles coffee grounds or is green
Schedule a doctor's visit
Make an appointment with your doctor if:
Vomiting lasts more than two days for adults, 24 hours for children under age 2 or 12 hours for infants
You've had bouts of nausea and vomiting for longer than one month
You've experienced unexplained weight loss along with nausea and vomiting
Take self-care measures while you wait for your appointment with your doctor:
Take it easy. Too much activity and not getting enough rest might make nausea worse.
Stay hydrated. Take small sips of cold, clear, carbonated or sour drinks, such as ginger ale, lemonade and water. Mint tea also may help. Oral rehydration solutions, such as Pedialyte, can aid in preventing dehydration.
Avoid strong odors and other triggers. Food and cooking smells, perfume, smoke, stuffy rooms, heat, humidity, flickering lights, and driving are among the possible triggers of nausea and vomiting.
Eat bland foods. Start with easily digested foods such as gelatin, crackers and toast. When you can keep these down, try cereal, rice, fruit, and salty or high-protein, high-carbohydrate foods. Avoid fatty or spicy foods. Wait to eat solid foods until about six hours after the last time you vomited.
Use nonprescription motion sickness medicines. If you're planning a trip, nonprescription motion sickness drugs, such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) or meclizine (Bonine) may help calm your queasy stomach. For longer journeys, such as a cruise, ask your health care provider about prescription motion sickness adhesive patches, such as scopolamine (Transderm Scop).

If your queasiness stems from pregnancy, try nibbling on some crackers before you get out of bed in the morning.
