Nasal congestion

Causes
By Mayo Clinic Staff
Anything that irritates the inside of the nose can cause a stuffy nose. Infections — such as colds, flu or sinusitis — and allergies often cause stuffy and runny noses. Irritants in the air, such as tobacco smoke, perfume, dust and car exhaust, also can cause these symptoms.
Some people have noses that are stuffy and run all the time without a known reason. This is called nonallergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis.
A polyp, an object such as a small toy stuck in the nose, or a tumor might cause the nose to run from only one side. Sometimes migraine-like headaches can cause a runny nose.
Possible causes of nasal congestion include:
Acute sinusitis
Alcohol
Allergies — Injury, such as from a blunt trauma or burn.
Chronic sinusitis
Churg-Strauss syndrome
Dry or cold air
Common cold
Decongestant nasal spray overuse
Deviated septum
Enlarged adenoids
Food, especially spicy dishes
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (a condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels)
Hormonal changes
Influenza (flu)
Medications, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, depression, seizures and other conditions
Nasal polyps
Nonallergic rhinitis
Object in the nose
Pregnancy
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Sleep apnea — a condition in which breathing stops and starts many times during sleep.
Thyroid disorders. 
Tobacco smoke

Definition
By Mayo Clinic Staff
Nasal congestion, also called stuffy nose, is a feeling of fullness in the nose or face. There also might be fluid running or dripping out of the nose or down the back of the throat.
Nasal congestion is often called rhinorrhea or rhinitis. But the terms are different. Rhinorrhea involves a thin, mostly clear fluid running from the nose. Rhinitis involves irritation and swelling inside the nose.
Overview

Chronic sinusitis

Chronic sinusitis causes the spaces inside the nose and head, called sinuses, to become inflamed and swollen. The condition lasts 12 weeks or longer, even with treatment.
This common condition keeps mucus from draining. It makes the nose stuffy. Breathing through the nose might be hard. The area around the eyes might feel swollen or tender.


Infection, growths in the sinuses, called nasal polyps, and swelling of the lining of the sinuses might all be part of chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis is also called chronic rhinosinusitis. The condition affects adults and children.
Symptoms
Common symptoms of chronic sinusitis include:
Thick, discolored mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose.
Mucus down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip.
Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose.
Pain, tenderness and swelling around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead.
Reduced sense of smell and taste.
Other symptoms can include:
Ear pain.
Headache.
Aching in the teeth.
Cough.
Sore throat.
Bad breath.
Tiredness.
Chronic sinusitis and acute sinusitis have similar symptoms. But acute sinusitis is a short-lived infection of the sinuses often linked to a cold.
The symptoms of chronic sinusitis last at least 12 weeks. There might be many bouts of acute sinusitis before it becomes chronic sinusitis. Fever isn't common with chronic sinusitis. But fever might be part of acute sinusitis.
When to see a doctor
Schedule an appointment with your health care provider for:
Repeated sinusitis, and if the condition doesn't get better with treatment.
Sinusitis symptoms that last more than 10 days.
See a health care provider right away if you have symptoms that could mean a serious infection:
Fever.
Swelling or redness around the eyes.
Bad headache.
Forehead swelling.
Confusion.
Double vision or other vision changes.
Stiff neck.

Causes

The cause of chronic sinusitis usually is not known. Some medical conditions, including cystic fibrosis, can cause chronic sinusitis in children and teens.
Some conditions can make chronic sinusitis worse. These include:
A common cold or other infection that affects the sinuses. Viruses or bacteria can cause these infections.
A problem inside the nose, such as a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps or tumors.
Risk factors
The following factors raise the risk of getting chronic sinusitis:
A dental infection.
A fungal infection.
Regularly being around cigarette smoke or other pollutants.
Complications
Serious complications of chronic sinusitis are rare. They can include:
Vision problems. If a sinus infection spreads to an eye socket, it can reduce vision or possibly cause blindness.
Infections. It's not common. But a serious sinus infection can spread to the membranes and fluid around the brain and spinal cord. The infection is called meningitis. Other serious infections can spread to the bones, called osteomyelitis, or to skin, called cellulitis.
Prevention
Take these steps to lower the risk of getting chronic sinusitis:
Protect your health. Try to stay away from people who have colds or other infections. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before meals.
Manage allergies. Work with your health care provider to keep symptoms under control. Stay away from things you're allergic to when possible.
Avoid cigarette smoke and polluted air. Tobacco smoke and other pollutants can irritate the lungs and inside the nose, called the nasal passages.
Use a humidifier. If the air in your home is dry, adding moisture to the air with a humidifier may help prevent sinusitis. Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, complete cleaning.
When to see a doctor
By Mayo Clinic Staff
For adults — See a health care provider if:
You have symptoms for more than 10 days.
You have a high fever.
What's coming from your nose is yellow or green. You also have sinus pain or fever. This may be a sign of a bacterial infection.
What's coming from your nose is bloody. Or your nose keeps running after a head injury.
Your face hurts.


For children — See a health care provider if:
Your child's symptoms don't get better or get worse.
Your baby's stuffy nose causes problems with nursing or breathing.
Self-care
Until you see a care provider, try these simple steps to relieve symptoms:
Avoid allergy causes.
Try an allergy medicine you can get without a prescription. If you're also sneezing and your eyes are itching or watering, your nose might be running because of allergies. Be sure to follow the label instructions exactly.
For babies, put several saline drops into one nostril. Then gently suction that nostril with a soft rubber-bulb syringe. 
To relieve saliva that builds up at the back of the throat, also known as postnasal drip, try these measures:
Avoid common irritants such as cigarette smoke and sudden humidity changes.
Drink plenty of liquids, such as water, juice or broth. Liquids help break up congestion.
Use nasal saline sprays or rinses.
