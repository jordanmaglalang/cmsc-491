Salivary glands
Enlarge image
Dry mouth, also called xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh), is when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. Dry mouth often is due to aging, the side effects of certain medicines or radiation therapy for cancer. Less often, a condition directly affecting the salivary glands can cause dry mouth. You also may experience dry mouth temporarily if you are thirsty or feel anxious about something.



For some people, dry mouth is only annoying. For others, dry mouth can greatly affect general health and the health of teeth and gums. Also, it can affect how much people eat and how much they enjoy what they eat.
Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause.

Symptoms
If you're not producing enough saliva, you may notice these symptoms all or most of the time:
Dryness or a feeling of stickiness in your mouth.
Saliva that seems thick and stringy.
Bad breath.
Having a hard time chewing, speaking and swallowing.
Dry or sore throat and hoarseness.
Dry or grooved tongue.
A changed sense of taste.
Problems wearing dentures.
Lipstick stuck to teeth.
Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away sugar and food particles and making bacteria neutral and less harmful. When you don't have enough saliva, you may find it harder to taste, chew and swallow. You also may have a hard time digesting food.
When to see a doctor
If you have dry mouth symptoms that don't go away, make an appointment with your healthcare professional.

Causes
Dry mouth is caused when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. Sometimes these glands may not work properly due to:
Medicines. Hundreds of medicines, including many medicines available without a prescription, can cause dry mouth. Among the medicines more likely to cause problems are those for depression, high blood pressure and anxiety, as well as some antihistamines, decongestants, muscle relaxants and pain relievers.
Aging. Many older people have symptoms of dry mouth as they age. Certain changes in how the body processes medicine, poor nutrition and long-term health problems can cause dry mouth.
Cancer therapy. Medicine to treat cancer, called chemotherapy, can change the nature of saliva and the amount produced. This may be for a limited time, with typical salivary flow returning after treatment ends. Radiation treatments to the head and neck can damage salivary glands, greatly lowering saliva production. This may be for a limited time, or it could be lasting, depending on the radiation dose and area treated.
Nerve damage. An injury or surgery that causes nerve damage to the head and neck area can be due to dry mouth.
Other health conditions. Dry mouth can be due to certain health conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, a yeast infection in the mouth or Alzheimer's disease. Or dry mouth could be due to autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome or HIV/AIDS.
Snoring and mouth breathing. Snoring and breathing with the mouth open can lead to dry mouth.
Tobacco and alcohol use. Drinking alcohol and smoking or chewing tobacco can lead to more dry mouth symptoms.
Use of legal or illegal drugs that may be sold on the streets.Methamphetamine use can cause serious dry mouth, and it can damage teeth. Marijuana use also can cause dry mouth.
Risk factors
Risk of dry mouth is higher in people who:
Take medicines that have dry mouth listed as a possible side effect.
Are being treated for cancer.
Have nerve damage in the head and neck area.
Have other health conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Sjogren syndrome or HIV/AIDS.
Use tobacco products.
Drink alcohol.
Use street drugs.
Eat sugary or acidic foods or candies.
Complications
Not having enough saliva and getting dry mouth can lead to:
Increased plaque, tooth decay and gum disease.
Mouth sores.
A yeast infection in the mouth, also known as thrush.
Sores or split skin at the corners of the mouth, or cracked lips.
Poor nutrition from having problems with chewing and swallowing.

Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free hard candies to help the flow of saliva. For some people, xylitol, which often is found in sugar-free gum or sugar-free candies, may cause diarrhea or cramps if a lot is eaten.
Limit your caffeine intake because caffeine can make your mouth drier.
Do not use mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they can dry your mouth.
Stop all tobacco use if you smoke or chew tobacco.
Sip water regularly.
Try saliva substitutes available without a prescription. Look for products containing xylitol, if you're not sensitive to it, such as Mouth Kote or Oasis Moisturizing Mouth Spray. Or look for products containing carboxymethylcellulose (kahr-bok-see-meth-ul-SEL-u-lohs) or hydroxyethyl cellulose (hi-drok-see-ETH-ul SEL-u-lohs), such as Biotene Dry Mouth Oralbalance Moisturizing Gel.
Try a mouthwash designed for dry mouth — especially one that contains xylitol, if you're not sensitive to it, such as Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse, bioXtra Dry Mouth Ultra Mild Mouthrinse or ACT Dry Mouth Mouthwash.
Stay away from antihistamines and decongestants available without a prescription because they can make your symptoms worse. Antihistamines are used to block the effects of histamine, a substance in your body that can cause symptoms of allergies. Decongestants are used to ease a stuffy nose by reducing the swelling of blood vessels in your nose.
Breathe through your nose, not your mouth.
Add moisture to the air at night with a room humidifier.
Saliva is important to keep your teeth and mouth healthy. If you often have a dry mouth, taking these steps to protect your oral health also may help:
Stay away from foods and drinks that have a lot of sugar or those that have a lot of acid,such as carbonated drinks. They raise your risk of tooth decay.
Stay away from dry, spicy, salty or hard-to-chew foods because they can cause pain when your mouth is dry.
Brush with a fluoride toothpaste — ask your dentist if a prescription fluoride toothpaste may help you. You also may be prescribed fluoride in addition to your toothpaste.
Use a fluoride rinse or brush-on fluoride gel before bedtime. Sometimes a custom-fit fluoride applicator that your dentist creates can make this more effective.
Visit your dentist at least once a year to detect and treat tooth decay or other dental problems. You may need to visit your dentist more often, depending on your dental needs.
If these steps do not make your dry mouth better, talk to your doctor or dentist. The cause could be a medicine or another health problem. Medicines are one of the most common causes of dry mouth. Easing dry mouth long term may mean stopping or changing your medicine or its dose, or looking at underlying health issues.

Diagnosis
To determine the cause of your dry mouth, your healthcare professional reviews your medical history and the medicines you take, including medicines available without a prescription. Your healthcare professional also looks in your mouth.
Sometimes you may need blood tests, imaging scans of your salivary glands or tests to measure how much saliva you produce. These scans and tests can help find the cause of your dry mouth. If your healthcare professional suspects that Sjogren syndrome is causing your dry mouth, a small sample of cells taken from salivary glands in your lip may be sent for testing. This procedure is called a biopsy.


Treatment
Your treatment depends on the cause of your dry mouth. Your healthcare professional may:
Change medicines that cause dry mouth. If your healthcare professional thinks a medicine is the cause, your dose may be changed. Or you may switch to another medicine that doesn't cause dry mouth.
Recommend products to moisturize your mouth. These products can include prescription medicines or mouth rinses available without a prescription, artificial saliva, or moisturizers to lubricate your mouth. Mouthwashes designed for dry mouth, especially ones with xylitol, can be effective. Examples include Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse or Act Dry Mouth Mouthwash.
If your mouth is extremely dry due to Sjogren syndrome or radiation treatment for head and neck cancer, your healthcare professional may prescribe pilocarpine (Salagen) to help you make more saliva. Or cevimeline (Evoxac) may be prescribed to help you make more saliva if you have Sjogren syndrome.


Lifestyle and home remedies
In addition to your healthcare professional's advice, these tips may ease dry mouth symptoms:
Sip water or sugar-free drinks or suck on ice chips. Do this throughout the day to moisten your mouth. Also, drink water during meals to make it easier to chew and swallow.
Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free hard candies. Products that contain xylitol also may help prevent cavities. But xylitol, which is often found in sugar-free gum and sugar-free candies, may cause some people to have gas or diarrhea if they consume it in large amounts.
Try saliva substitutes that contain xylitol and are available without a prescription. These include Mouth Kote or Oasis Moisturizing Mouth Spray. Or try saliva substitutes that contain carboxymethylcellulose (kahr-bok-see-meth-ul-SEL-u-lohs) or hydroxyethyl cellulose (hi-drok-see-ETH-ul SEL-u-lohs), such as Biotene Dry Mouth Oralbalance Gel.
Breathe through your nose, not your mouth. You may need to seek treatment for snoring if it causes you to breathe through your mouth during the night.
Add moisture to the air at night. Use a room humidifier.
Moisturize your lips. This helps soothe dry or cracked areas.
Stay away from products that can make your symptoms worse. These include:
Caffeine and alcohol. These products can cause dryness and irritation. Don't use a mouthwash that contains alcohol.
Tobacco. If you smoke or chew tobacco, stop. Tobacco products can dry and irritate your mouth.
Antihistamines and decongestants available without a prescription.These medicines can worsen your dry mouth.
Sugary or acidic foods and candies. These foods raise the risk of tooth decay. Also, stay away from spicy or salty foods because they can cause irritation.
Saliva is important to maintain the health of your teeth and mouth. Taking these steps to protect your teeth also may help your dry mouth:
Brush with a fluoride toothpaste and floss your teeth. Ask your dentist if you might benefit from prescription fluoride toothpaste, a toothpaste containing betaine or a tooth gel to neutralize bacteria acids.
Use fluoride or rinses. To prevent cavities, your dentist might fit you for fluoride trays, which you fill with fluoride and wear over your teeth at night. Your dentist also may recommend that you brush on fluoride gel before bedtime or use a chlorhexidine rinse weekly.
See your dentist at least twice yearly. Have your teeth examined and plaque removed to help prevent tooth decay.

ROCHESTER, Minn. — Millions of people are affected by chronic dry mouth, or xerostomia, an agonizing side effect of damaged salivary glands. While chemotherapy and radiation treatment for head and neck cancer are the most common causes of this, aging, certain medications and other factors, including diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and HIV/AIDS, can also cause chronic dry mouth. Currently, there is no cure for it.
Mayo Clinic researchers have established the world's first biobank of human salivary gland tissue-organoids that opens the door to research to find a cure.

"This unique biobank resource overcomes a major barrier we've faced in the field, namely: limited access to standardized salivary specimens suited for salivary gland regeneration research. This collection provides a foundation for regenerative therapy development, especially for radiation-induced chronic dry mouth," says Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D., lead author of the studypublished in NPJ Regenerative Medicine. Dr. Kannan is also the director of the Mayo Clinic Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory.
Nearly 70% of patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy experience permanent damage to their salivary glands. People with this condition experience diminished quality of life from a constant feeling like cotton is lining their mouths. Besides being uncomfortable, chronic dry mouth can lead to difficulties with chewing, tasting, speaking and swallowing. It also can cause tooth decay.
"Chronic dry mouth can extend long after radiation treatments are complete. It's among the top concerns I hear from patients with head and neck cancer. Unfortunately, there aren't many therapeutics available commercially for these patients," says co-author Jeffrey Janus, M.D., an ear, nose and throat specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.
One promising avenue of research is the cultivation of rare regenerative cells to greater numbers that can help people someday heal and grow new, healthy salivary gland cells. The biobank consists of specimens collected from 208 donors. From this repository, researchers have already found biomarkers for mature, saliva-producing cells, and with the help of a high-resolution protein map, they have identified the potential tissue origin of rare, self-renewing salivary cells.
The research team also developed a radiation injury model, which paired with the biobank, provides an integrated platform to discover new, personalized regenerative biotherapeutics.
Mayo Clinic Q & A: Before changing medication, try other strategies to manage dry mouth
Liza Torborg
April 11, 2015
    
DEAR MAYO CLINIC: Is there anything that can be done for dry mouth? I take a medication that lists this as one of the side effects and am having a hard time getting used to it. Before I consider changing medications, I’d like to know if dry mouth can be treated.
ANSWER: Treatment is available for dry mouth. Before you switch to a different medication, there are a number of strategies you can try to reduce this bothersome condition. Because dry mouth puts you at higher risk for dental decay, along with treating your symptoms it is important that you limit the amount of sugar in your diet and take steps to maintain your oral health.
The saliva in your mouth is made in the salivary glands. Those glands are located in front of your ears and near your jaw. Saliva serves a variety of useful purposes. It helps prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acids that bacteria make. It limits bacterial growth in your mouth. Saliva washes away food particles, and enzymes within saliva help with digestion. Saliva also enhances your ability to taste and makes it easier to swallow.
It is common for medications to trigger dry mouth — a condition sometimes called xerostomia. Dry mouth can be a side effect of hundreds of medications, including many over-the-counter drugs. The condition tends to be associated with drugs used to treat depression, nerve pain and anxiety. Dry mouth also is common with the use of some antihistamines, decongestants, muscle relaxants and pain medications.
The severity of dry mouth due to medication varies significantly from one person to another. The main effect is usually a lack of lubrication to your tongue and cheeks that can make it hard to speak, chew or swallow. Other symptoms include dryness in your throat, saliva that seems thick and stringy, bad breath, a changed sense of taste, problems wearing dentures or gum irritation.
Treating dry mouth usually involves both increasing saliva production and managing the effects of dryness on your daily activities.
An easy and inexpensive way to try to stimulate your salivary glands to make more saliva is by chewing sugarless gum. Chewing prompts the glands to make more saliva, and chewing gum takes advantage of that natural reaction. For some people, regularly chewing gum is all they need to ease dry mouth.
If gum is not enough, you may want to talk with your doctor about medications to increase saliva production. Prescription medications such as pilocarpine or cevimeline often are effective, but some people need to take them for up to eight weeks before they start to get relief.
You can try managing dry mouth using a number of techniques to lessen the condition’s effect. For example, eating cool or cold foods that have a high liquid content — such as yogurt, cottage cheese, ice cream or popsicles — can make chewing and swallowing easier. Adding extra liquid to solid foods or blending your foods also can help.
Drink water or other sugar-free liquids or suck on ice chips throughout the day to help moisten your mouth. Avoid beverages that contain alcohol or caffeine, as both can increase dry mouth and cause irritation. Drink plenty of liquids with your meals to make eating solid foods easier.
Over-the-counter products are available that work as saliva substitutes. These products come in a spray that you squirt into your mouth. Although they can effectively add moisture to your mouth, the results usually do not last long. They tend to be most helpful when used to relieve symptoms for a short period of time, such as right before giving a presentation or before eating a meal.
If dry mouth persists despite these measures and becomes a daily nuisance, then consider talking with your doctor about finding a suitable alternative to the medication you are taking that is causing your dry mouth. — Alan Carr, D.M.D., Dental Specialties, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.
